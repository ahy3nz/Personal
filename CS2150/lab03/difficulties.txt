One of the difficulties I had was dealing with negative numbers and subtraction. My solution was just to code ifelse statements for every scenario
another problem was converting a series of characters (a string) into an int. I had to look up various methods to convert strings to ints. Initially, I coded such that a character would be converted to int, but not a series of characters as as tring to an int
